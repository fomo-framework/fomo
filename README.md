## About Fomo

Fomo is a web application framework based.

We tried to implement FOMO in the simplest possible way so that anyone can use it.

Fomo supports the following:
- Simple, fast routing engine.
- Processing work in the background
- Queued job processing,and....

Fomo is very fast, simple and for use in large scales (Of course, it still has flaws :grin:)
